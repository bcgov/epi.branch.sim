\usage{
draw_traced_status(n, sim.params)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of cases to consider}

\item{sim.params}{\code{sim.params} object (a list) containing simulation parameters, where
all of the information needed to determine the probability of a case being
traced (\code{p.trace}) are found within:
\itemize{
\item \code{sim.params$vary.trace}: Boolean to determine whether
\code{p.trace} varies based on cluster size or whether a single constant
value for \code{p.trace} is used.
\item \code{sim.params$p.trace_vary}: Defines the \code{p.trace} value for
each cluster size group. Ignored if \code{sim.params$vary.trace} is \code{FALSE}.
\item \code{sim.params$p.trace}: Constant \code{p.trace} value used at all times.
Ignored if \code{sim.params$vary.trace} is \code{TRUE}.
}}
}
\value{
A boolean vector of length n for each case's manual tracing status
}
\description{
Draws a uniform random number and compares to trace probability to determine
whether a case will be manually traced.
}
\details{
The probability of a case being traced, \code{p.trace}, can either be a value that varies
with cluster size (if \code{sim.params$vary.trace} is \code{TRUE}) or a constant value equal
to \code{sim.params$p.trace} if \code{sim.params$vary.trace} is \code{FALSE}.

When variable tracing based on cluster size is used, \code{n} is assumed to be the cluster size
because it is assumed that this function would be called be \code{create_state_df} for all
secondary infections together. The three possible variable tracing values are for cluster sizes of:
less than 10 cases, 11-24 cases and 25 or more cases. The vector \code{sim.params$p.trace_vary}
sets the trace probability for each of these three cluster sizes.
