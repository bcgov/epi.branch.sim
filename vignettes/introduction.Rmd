This introductory vignette gives a high level overview of the package, the simulation algorithm, and the four main simulation objects. 

## Simulation algorithm

This package implements a [stochastic branching process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_process) inspired by [Hellewell et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30074-7) to simulate the evolution of an infectious disease in a population. This simulation includes factors that add to disease growth (such as importation of cases) or limit disease growth (such as physical distancing and contact tracing). Disease and behaviourial parameters for each case are stochastically generated from user-defined distribution when each case is initialized. This includes properties such as time to symptom onset and time of secondary infections (generation intervals). Because our simulation runs forward one time-step at a time, disease milestones such as symptom onset or secondary infections are essentially "pre-loaded" when the case is generated but don't actually occur in the simulation until their corresponding time-step. This allows for processes to be time-dependent and/or depend on the current state of other cases (e.g. the efficiency of contact tracing could depend on the number of active cases that require tracing) and creates snapshots of the simulation at every timestep. 

### Case statuses
We consider every case to be in one of five disease states:

* **incubation**: This state describes cases that have been infected and could infect others. It is the initial state for all cases. All four other states are possible after the incubation stage. Typically, the case moves onto the **symptomatic** or **asyptomatic** state (based on a stochastically determined value) after the case's incubation period (also stochastically determined) has passed. However, cases may directly move to **isolated** or **inactive** states prior to the end of their incubation period in certain cases. For instance, cases move directly to the **isolated** state if their isolation time is shorter than the incubation period, which could happen when the case is a traced contact of an isolated index case. Alternatively, if the infection duration (a user defined parameter) has passed before the end of the incubation period, then the case moves directly to the **inactive** state. This pathway is relatively rare, as it only occurs when the stochastic process generates a very long incubation period.

* **symptomatic**: This state describes cases determined to be symptomatic and pass their incubation period without being isolated, or exceed their infection duration. Cases in this state can cause secondary infections. For untraced cases, entering this state is an important milestone as it starts the counter for their isolation timeline.  Cases in this state will move to the **isolated** state after their onset-to-isolation delay time has passed. However, if the case reaches the end of their infection duration before isolation occurs, then they will move to the **inactive** state instead.

* **asymptomatic**: This state describes cases determined to be asymptomatic and pass their incubation period without being isolated or exceed their infection duration. Cases in this state can cause secondary infections. Traced asymptomatic cases may move to the **isolated** state if their isolation delay is shorter than their infection duration. Otherwise, traced asymptomatic cases move to the **inactive** state at the end of their infection. Untraced asymptomatic cases can only move to the **inactive** state after their infection duration has passed. Note that the infection duration can be set to a very large number, in which case untraced asymptomatic cases may remain in the **asymptomatic** indefinitely.

* **isolated**: This state describes cases that have been isolated from the main population and can no longer cause secondary infections. Traced cases can arrive at this state from any of the above states after some stochastically determined delay beyond the index case's isolation. This delay can be as short as 0 days. Untraced symptomatic cases arrive at this state after a different stochastically determined delay beyond their own onset of symptoms. This is one of the two potential end states. All cases that reach this state will remain **isolated** for the rest of the simulation. 

* **inactive**: This state describes cases that are not isolated but are no longer considered to have the disease and are no longer causing secondary infections. Cases can arrive to this state from any of the **incubation**, **symptomatic** or **asymptomatic** states if they reach the end of their stochastically drawn infection duration period before advancing to the **isolated** state. The use of this state is *optional*: if the infection duration parameter is set to a very large value (e.g. longer than the total duration of the simulation) then cases will never reach this state. The purpose of this state is to avoid retaining a very large number of untraced asymptomatic cases that are no longer affecting the simulation as well as to avoid the rare situation where the generation interval distribution leads to a stochastic draw of an unrealistic and very large generation interval (in cases where this event is not meant to be included in the simulation).

Depending on the application, counts of some states can be used to compute useful metrics. For instance, the count of cases in the symptomatic state can be used to as an input to estimate the required healthcare capacity. The count of all active cases (incubation, symptomatic and asymptomatic) can be used to estimate the levels of required medical interventions (e.g. hopsitalizations, ICU). The count of isolated cases can be used to roughly approximate the number of cases that are known to public health authorities, especially if assuming isolation orders come from these authorities and/or people self-isolate after self-reporting.

### What happens in each timestep
This is the order of operations in each simulation time-step as implemented by the `step_simulation()` function.

1. The overall simulation time counter and each case's time infected counter is incremented by the time-step.

2. Secondary infections that would have occurred since the last timestep are generated with all of their stochastically determined parameters drawn from their respective distributions. This list of secondary cases is kept separate from the list of current active cases in the simulation for now.

3. If the time-step is a whole number, then the number of imported cases is determined and these cases are generated with all of their stochastically determined parameters drawn from their respective distributions. This list of imported cases is kept separate from the list of current active cases in the simulation for now.

4. All cases that have been active for longer than their infection duration since the last time-step are advanced to the inactive state and are not considered for any further case status advancements.

5. The remaining active cases are assessed for advancement.
  + Cases in the incubation state are advanced to symptomatic, asymptomatic or directly to isolated based on the timelines described above.
  + Then, cases in the symptomatic state are advanced to isolated if they meet the conditions.
  + Finally, cases in the asymptomatic state are advanced to isolated if they meet the conditions.
  
6. Cases now in the inactive or isolated states are removed from the active cases list.

7. New secondary and imported cases generated earlier are added to the bottom of the active cases list, in that order.

8. End of time-step.

## Description of main simulation objects

The simulation is controlled by four objects. We keep all information within these objects so that we just have to pass these objects to the underlying functions. New features can be added to the model by simply adding more entries to these objects. The four objects are:

* `sim_params` is a named list containing the global parameters that control the evolution of all cases. These include the disease parameters, simulation control parameters, and the definition of the distributions used to draw case-specific parameters. The values in this list are constant (fixed) within a simulation.

* `sim_status` is a named list acting as the "state vector" containing bookkeeping quantities not specific to any case. This is updated at every time-step of the simulation.

* `state_df` is a data frame acting as a state vector for all active cases. It should contain all the information about a case required to determine what happens to that case during a simulation. It is updated several times during each simulation step.

* `record_df` is a data frame acting as a log of important attributes of all cases ever created in the simulation. It is updated several times during each simulation step.

**N.B.** The general idea is that `state_df` only contains information required to determine the trajectory of a case in a simulation. Cases that are no longer active are removed from `state_df` at the end of each step. On the other hand, `record_df` tracks quantities of interest for all cases in the simulation. Driver functions should be sampling from one or both of these two objects to generate summary metrics for analysis.


## Next steps
Ready for your first simulation? This [first example](first_example.html) vignette will go through the steps to set up a simulation, run it, and extract metrics from it.

In the future, we will present vignettes showing examples of this package applied to outbreak simulation on a large scale, such as a vignette reproducing the main results from [Hellewell et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30074-7). We will also show vignettes that demonstrate one method to fit to reported case counts and forecast future case counts. They will be linked here when ready.
